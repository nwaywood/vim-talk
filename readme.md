# speaking-the-language-of-vim

To this day, Vim remains one of the most popular text editors amoung engineers and scientists. Whether it's to make your day-to-day Python/R/C++ editing more productive or just to edit bash scripts from time to time, learning Vim is a fun and worthwile thing to do.

In this talk I aim to convey what it means to edit in Vim by "speaking the language" as well as describe some more advanced Vim features and show how I use Vim.
